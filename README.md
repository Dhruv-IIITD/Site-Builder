# 🌐 SiteBuilder – AI-Powered Website Builder

SiteBuilder is a **full-stack, AI-powered, token-based website builder** that allows users to generate and deploy complete websites simply by writing **natural language prompts**. It combines modern web technologies, secure payments, and scalable infrastructure to deliver a production-ready platform.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Instead of manually coding a website:

1. Users **buy tokens**
2. They **describe the website they want**
3. AI **generates the website**
4. Users **preview, download and deploy it**

Tokens act as **currency**, and Stripe handles **secure payments**.

---



## 🚀 Key Features Explained

### 🪙 Token-Based System

* Users must purchase tokens before building websites
* Tokens control usage, prevent abuse, and enable monetization
* Each website generation or premium template consumes tokens

---

### 🧠 AI Prompt-Based Website Generation

* Users describe their site using natural language
  Example:
  *“Create a portfolio website with a dark theme and contact form”*
* Backend processes the prompt and generates site structure, content, and layout

---

### ⬇️ Website Code Download (HTML & CSS)

* Users can **download the generated website source code**
* Output includes:

  * Clean **HTML**
  * Styled **CSS**
* Downloaded code can be:

  * Hosted on any platform
  * Modified manually
  * Used as a starting template

This gives users **full ownership and flexibility** over their generated websites.

---

### 💳 Secure Payments with **Stripe**

* Stripe Checkout is used for token purchases
* Stripe Webhooks confirm successful payments
* Tokens are credited only after verified payment

---

### 🗄️ Scalable Database with **Neon**

* Uses serverless PostgreSQL
* Stores users, token balances, generated websites, and transactions
* Highly scalable and production-ready

---

### ⚡ Modern Full-Stack Architecture

* Clean separation of frontend and backend
* Easy to scale, maintain, and deploy
* Uses Node.js throughout the stack
